### 🧠 About Me
I am an **Applied ML Specialist at the Vector Institute**, specializing in **Responsible and Generative AI**.  
My work bridges **research and engineering**, focusing on **AI governance, bias detection**, and **explainable alignment frameworks** for large language models.

I am deeply interested in **trust mechanisms** for LLMs — integrating **policy-aligned frameworks** such as the **EU AI Act**, **NIST AI Risk Management Framework**, and **ISO/IEC 42001** into model evaluation and deployment.  
I’m particularly passionate about creating systems that are not only powerful but *accountable, interpretable, and sustainable*.

My recent contributions include:
- Designing preference-alignment pipelines (DPO, ORPO, KTO) using **Qwen2-7B** and **Gemma 2B**.  
- Building **LangChain-based RAG pipelines** and **multi-agent architectures** for clinical and legal document reasoning.  
- Reviewing **AI governance and LLM oversight papers** for the **AAAI 2026 Workshop on AI Governance (AIGOV)**, helping assess global approaches to *human-centered supervision, explainability, and regulatory alignment* in LLM research.
